**NOTE**: I will work on this project in my spare time so don't expect this to be very active. This project will always be open-sourced.

[Description]
An anticheat designed to detect and ban players who use unfair cheats (anticheat). If you're wondering if I skidded anything, the answer is no. While I did get ideas from people and worked with others on this project, nothing was skidded from the web. This project will always be open-sourced and free, so you can use this anticheat on your server and modify it to fit your server needs.

**TODO**:

[System]
- Migrate from Atlas to Purplex's Packet Library (https://github.com/purplexdev/packetevents)
- Integrate a form of server-side interpolation for better predictions and processing

[Detection]
- Patch Void-TP disabler
- Patch CrackLag disabler/fake lag method
