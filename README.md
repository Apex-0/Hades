# Hades (Anticheat)
**IMPORTANT**: I will work on this project in my spare time so don't expect this to be very active. If you want to use any of the code from this project, please credit me and all of the contributors when publishing anything with our code.

**CONTRIBUTORS**: ExslodingDogs, Vaziak, Purplex

**DESCRIPTION**:
An advanced anticheat with many heuristic checks designed to patch various cheats/hacks. The goal of this project is to provide a free anticheat solution for servers that automatically punishes any player that uses any form of cheat. This project will always be open-sourced and free, so you can use this anticheat on your server and modify it to fit your server needs. None of the code is stolen from other online sources or people without being credited.

**TODO**:
- Integrate a form of server-side interpolation for better predictions and processing
- Patch Void-TP disabler
- Patch CrackLag disabler/fake lag method
