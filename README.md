NOTE: I will work on this project in my spare time so don't expect this to be very active.

IMPORTANT: If you want to use any of the code from this plugin, please credit me and all of the contributors when publishing anything with our code.

An anticheat built with the Atlas library. If you're wondering if I skidded anything, the answer is no. While I did get ideas from people and worked with others on this project, nothing was skidded from the web.

Contributions from: ExslodingDogs, Vaziak

TODO:

- Migrate from Atlas to Purplex's Packet Library (https://github.com/purplexdev/packetevents)
- Integrate a form of server-side interpolation for better predictions and processing
